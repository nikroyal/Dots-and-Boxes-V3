## 2024-05-28 - Missing Pre-Validation of Friend Requests
**Vulnerability:** A user could unilaterally add themselves to any other user's `friends` array without a pending friend request, bypassing consent.
**Learning:** The previous `firestore.rules` allowed a user to arbitrarily append their UID to another user's `friends` array. Since there was no server-side proof that the target user had initiated a friend request (as the target's request was just an uncontrolled map in the receiving user's document), authorization was fundamentally flawed.
**Prevention:** Implemented an `outgoingFriendRequests` array that the sender manages. The Firestore rules now verify that the target user explicitly authorized the addition by requiring `request.auth.uid` to be present in (and subsequently removed from) the target user's `outgoingFriendRequests` list before allowing modifications to their `friends` array.
## 2024-06-18 - Fix custom random float division in avatar selection
**Vulnerability:** A custom float division (`/ 4294967296 * length`) combined with `Math.floor` was used with `crypto.getRandomValues` to generate random array indices for avatars.
**Learning:** This approach recreates a pseudo `Math.random()` leading to floating point precision issues. While low impact for avatars, it demonstrates poor cryptographic hygiene and is prone to errors.
**Prevention:** Always use standard modulo arithmetic (`crypto.getRandomValues(array)[0] % length`) or unbiased random selection algorithms when choosing a random element from an array based on cryptographic values.
## 2026-06-17 - Hardcoded Firebase API Key and Config
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded Firebase API Key and config parameters inside src/lib/firebase.js
**Learning:** The code directly contained the production/development Firebase keys rather than reading them from environment variables, which leaks credentials and secrets into the source repository.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables for keys and external configuration values (e.g., using import.meta.env in Vite) and ensure they are well documented in .env.example so that actual keys are never committed to the repository.
