## 2024-05-28 - Missing Pre-Validation of Friend Requests
**Vulnerability:** A user could unilaterally add themselves to any other user's `friends` array without a pending friend request, bypassing consent.
**Learning:** The previous `firestore.rules` allowed a user to arbitrarily append their UID to another user's `friends` array. Since there was no server-side proof that the target user had initiated a friend request (as the target's request was just an uncontrolled map in the receiving user's document), authorization was fundamentally flawed.
**Prevention:** Implemented an `outgoingFriendRequests` array that the sender manages. The Firestore rules now verify that the target user explicitly authorized the addition by requiring `request.auth.uid` to be present in (and subsequently removed from) the target user's `outgoingFriendRequests` list before allowing modifications to their `friends` array.
## 2024-06-18 - Fix custom random float division in avatar selection
**Vulnerability:** A custom float division (`/ 4294967296 * length`) combined with `Math.floor` was used with `crypto.getRandomValues` to generate random array indices for avatars.
**Learning:** This approach recreates a pseudo `Math.random()` leading to floating point precision issues. While low impact for avatars, it demonstrates poor cryptographic hygiene and is prone to errors.
**Prevention:** Always use standard modulo arithmetic (`crypto.getRandomValues(array)[0] % length`) or unbiased random selection algorithms when choosing a random element from an array based on cryptographic values.
## 2026-06-21 - Hardcoded Firebase Credentials Exposing Application to Takeover
**Vulnerability:** Firebase initialization parameters including the `apiKey`, `projectId` and `appId` were hardcoded directly in `src/lib/firebase.js`.
**Learning:** Hardcoding sensitive configuration directly into source code makes it available to anyone with access to the code base, and commits it into source control forever, violating basic secrets management.
**Prevention:** Always source sensitive configuration, especially API keys, from environment variables (e.g., using `import.meta.env` in Vite). Provide a `.env.example` for developers to create local configurations safely.
